## Installation

It's available on melpa:
```
M-x package-install pomidor
```

Or using [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) with global keybinding, disabled tick-tack sound and custom hook:
```elisp
(use-package pomidor
  :bind (("<f12>" . pomidor))
  :config (setq pomidor-sound-tick nil
                pomidor-sound-tack nil)
  :hook (pomidor-mode . (lambda ()
                          (display-line-numbers-mode -1) ; Emacs 26.1+
                          (setq left-fringe-width 0 right-fringe-width 0)
                          (setq left-margin-width 2 right-margin-width 0)
                          ;; force fringe update
                          (set-window-buffer nil (current-buffer)))))
```

Or clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/TatriX/pomidor ~/.emacs.d/pomidor
```
and add to your init file:
```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/pomidor/")
(require 'pomidor)

```

## Usage

Bind it to a key with the following command if you haven't done this with `use-package`:

```elisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f12>") #'pomidor)
```
Or run simply `M-x pomidor`

When you start pomidor, you automatically begin your first
pomodoro. There is nothing to do at this point, except for work. You
can, of course, restart the pomodoro if you get distracted, but the
program takes care of itself until the 25-minute mark is reached. At
this point the overwork period starts and lasts until you press
`Space` to start break period.

Then you can press `Space` (which asks for confirmation) or `Enter` to start a new period.

After 5 minutes of break time, pomidor will start telling you that you
should finish your break. To snooze it just press `Space` and select
`n`.

This cycle goes on forever.

## History mode

You can save your pomodoro sessions in a file and compare your
progress through this methodology as time goes by.

When you desire to save a session just do `M-x pomidor-save-session`,
it will ask to close your pomidor and will save the current state to a
file defined by `pomidor-save-session-file` defaults to
`~/.emacs.d/pomidor-sessions.json`.

The name of each session stored is the timestamp of the time you
choose to save the session.

After that you can fire `M-x pomidor-history` to take a look at your
snapshots. You can press `n` (`pomidor-history-next`) or `p`
(`pomidor-history-previous`) to navigate between the snapshots.

## Keybindings

| Key   | Description          |
|-------|----------------------|
| Enter | Start new pomodoro.  |
| Space | Start a break.       |
| R     | Resets the timer.    |
| q     | Quit pomidor buffer. |
| Q     | Turns off pomidor.   |

## Customization

You can customize pomidor with `M-x customize-group RET pomidor` or just edit your `.emacs`.

To change timer duration:
```elisp
(setq pomidor-seconds (* 25 60)) ; 25 minutes for the work period
(setq pomidor-break-seconds (* 5 60)) ; 5 minutes break time

```

To disable or configure sounds:
```elisp
(setq pomidor-sound-tick nil
      pomidor-sound-tack nil
      pomidor-sound-overwork (expand-file-name (concat pomidor-dir "overwork.wav"))
	  pomidor-sound-break-over (expand-file-name (concat (getenv "HOME") "/Music/overwork.wav")))
```

To change appearance your can [(customize-face)](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Face-Customization.html), use your theme or use elisp:
```elisp
;; for a full list of available faces see `customize' or search for `defface' in the source code
(set-face-attribute 'pomidor-break-face nil :foreground "#00ff00")
(set-face-attribute 'pomidor-overwork-face nil :foreground "#00abff")
(set-face-attribute 'pomidor-skip-face nil :foreground "#abbac3")
(set-face-attribute 'pomidor-work-face nil :foreground "#ff0000")
```

## Sound
If your Emacs cannot play sounds you can provide your own function to do it:
```elisp
(setq pomidor-play-sound-file
      (lambda (file)
        (start-process "my-pomidor-play-sound"
                       nil
                       "mplayer"
                       file)))
```

## Notifications
By default pomidor will show you an overwork notification once per minute.
See [alert](https://github.com/jwiegley/alert/) documentation to learn how to change alert settings.

You can change default notification style globally:
```elisp
(setq alert-default-style 'libnotify)
;; or 'growl (see alert docs)
```

To change notification you can set `pomidor-alert` variable (defaults to `pomidor-default-alert`):
```elisp
(setq pomidor-alert (lambda () (alert "OMG!11")))
```

Also you can set `pomidor-update-hook` to do some work on every update.
```elisp
(defun my-pomidor-update-hook ()
  (alert "Zzz"))

(add-hook 'pomidor-update-hook #'my-pomidor-update-hook)
```

You can adjust update interval by setting `pomidor-update-interval` variable
```elisp
(setq pomidor-update-interval 30) ; seconds
```
